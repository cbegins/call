# Echo example

In order to run this example, you'll need to update `APP_ID` and `APP_TOKEN` after creating an SFU Application in the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/calls).

```js
const APP_ID = "$APP_ID";
// ❗❗❗ DO NOT USE YOUR TOKEN IN THE BROWSER FOR PRODUCTION. It should be kept and used server-side.
const APP_TOKEN = "$APP_TOKEN";
```
